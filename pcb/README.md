# Open Dynamic Clamp Hardware Schematics

This directory contains hardware schematics for various versions of Open Dynamic Clamp.
Each directory represents a distinct iteration of the hardware.

Every attempt is made to ensure that each hardware revision is compatible with the latest firmware.
If a hardware revision is not compatible with certain features they will be documented.
The Open Dynamic Clamp Workbench software is able to distinguish hardware revisions and configure itself appropriately.
